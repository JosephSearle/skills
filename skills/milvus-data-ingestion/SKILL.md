# Milvus Data Ingestion Skill

All write operations: insert, upsert, delete, and bulk insert. Provides universal batching
guidance based on Milvus defaults with a clear instruction to check milvus-context →
Deployment overrides for any managed-service message-size caps.

---

## Core Philosophy

Do not flush after every insert. Milvus auto-seals segments when they reach the configured
threshold — manual flush after every batch creates unnecessary compaction pressure and hurts
throughput. Flush explicitly only after the final batch of a large load session or before backup.

---

## Step 1 — Confirm collection is ready

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_get_collection_info",
  "arguments": { "collection_name": "my_collection" }
}
```

`load_state` must be `"Loaded"` before any insert. If not loaded, call
`milvus_load_collection` first (see milvus-collection-lifecycle).

---

## Step 2 — Calculate safe batch size

Default gRPC message limit: **64 MB** (self-hosted). Check milvus-context → Deployment
overrides — some managed deployments enforce a lower cap.

**Per-row size formula:**

```
bytes_per_row = (dim × 4)         # FLOAT_VECTOR: 4 bytes per float
              + scalar_field_bytes  # VARCHAR: actual char count + overhead
```

**Example:** dim=768 FLOAT_VECTOR + 1 KB metadata → ~4 KB/row → **10,000 rows/batch** at 40 MB.

Target: **20–40 MB per insert call** for optimal throughput on self-hosted Milvus.

---

## Step 3 — Insert data in batches

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_insert_data",
  "arguments": {
    "collection_name": "my_collection",
    "data": [
      {"chunk_text": "...", "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, "..."], "category": "finance"},
      {"chunk_text": "...", "embedding": [0.3, 0.4, "..."], "category": "tech"}
    ]
  }
}
```

1. Split dataset into batches sized per Step 2
2. Call `milvus_insert_data` for each batch
3. **Do NOT flush between batches** — let Milvus auto-seal segments
4. For large sessions (>500K cumulative rows): flush explicitly every ~500K rows

**Upsert vs insert:** Upsert overwrites on primary key collision — use when the source may
re-emit previously ingested records. Keep the combined upsert + delete rate ≤0.5 MB/s to
avoid compaction overload.

---

## Step 4 — Delete entities

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_delete_entities",
  "arguments": {
    "collection_name": "my_collection",
    "filter_expr": "id in [101, 102, 103]"
  }
}
```

- Deleted entities may still appear under Bounded consistency until compaction runs
- Use `consistency_level: "Strong"` in searches if immediate deletion visibility is required
- **Mass deletion (>30% of collection):** consider recreating the collection — faster than
  waiting for compaction (see milvus-lifecycle-compaction-ttl)

---

## Step 5 — Bulk insert for large datasets (>500K vectors)

No MCP tool exists for bulk insert. Use the PyMilvus SDK with object storage:

```python
# 1. Prepare data as Parquet or JSON files in object storage (MinIO, S3, GCS, etc.)

# 2. Trigger bulk insert
task_id = client.do_bulk_insert(
    collection_name="my_collection",
    files=["s3://bucket/data/chunk1.parquet", "s3://bucket/data/chunk2.parquet"],
)

# 3. Poll until complete
import time
while True:
    state = client.get_bulk_insert_state(task_id=task_id)
    if state.state_name in ("Completed", "Failed"):
        break
    time.sleep(5)
```

---

## Step 6 — Flush and verify

**Flush** (only after final batch or before backup):

```python
client.flush("my_collection")
```

**Verify insert:**

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_query",
  "arguments": {
    "collection_name": "my_collection",
    "filter_expr": "id == 101",
    "output_fields": ["id", "chunk_text"]
  }
}
```

Check `milvus_get_collection_info` to confirm `row_count` reflects the inserted data.

## Step 7 — Resolve common failures

| Error | Root cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| "message size too large" | Batch exceeds deployment cap | Check milvus-context overrides; halve batch size |
| Rate limit / throttling | Write rate too high | Add sleep between batches; use exponential backoff |
| Collection not loaded | Collection in Released state | Call `milvus_load_collection` first |
| Insert succeeds but search returns empty | Consistency lag | Wait for Bounded window or switch to Strong |
