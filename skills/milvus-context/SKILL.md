name: milvus-context
description: >
  Shared reference card for all Milvus operations. Load this skill FIRST whenever any
  milvus-* skill is triggered. Use whenever the user mentions Milvus, vector database,
  embedding store, collection, or any milvus-* skill is about to run. Contains Milvus
  deployment modes, cluster limits, index types, consistency levels, schema constraints,
  scalar index types, and authentication patterns. Operators must fill in the Deployment
  overrides section for environment-specific constraints.

# Milvus Context

A shared reference card loaded before every other milvus-* skill. Contains the universal
facts, limits, and options that all other Milvus skills defer to rather than re-state.

---

## Step 1 — Identify deployment mode

| Mode | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Milvus Lite | In-process, single file | Dev and test only; no persistence across restarts |
| Standalone | Single server node | Small-scale production; no resource groups |
| Distributed | Multi-node on Kubernetes | Full feature set; resource groups require this mode |
| Managed cloud | Provider-hosted | Feature set varies; check Deployment overrides below |

---

## Step 2 — Confirm cluster-wide limits

1. Databases per cluster: **64 maximum**
2. Collections per cluster: **65,536 maximum**
3. Partitions per collection: **4,095 maximum**
4. Vector fields per collection: **4 maximum**
5. topK ceiling: **16,384**; `limit + offset` must not exceed 16,384
6. Segment indexing threshold: segments with fewer than **1,024 rows** use brute-force

## Step 3 — Confirm available index types

| Index | Best for | Key params | Constraints |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| HNSW | Default; <50 M vectors; recall ≥95% | M=16, efConstruction=256 | Graph in RAM (high memory) |
| IVF_FLAT | >50 M vectors or topK >2000 | nlist=√N, nprobe=16 | Medium memory |
| IVF_SQ8 | Memory-constrained, slight accuracy drop | nlist=√N, nprobe=16 | Low-medium memory |
| IVF_PQ | Most memory-constrained | nlist=√N, m=dim/4, nbits=8 | m must divide dim evenly |
| SCANN | IVF_PQ alternative with better recall | nlist=√N | Low memory |
| DISKANN | Dataset larger than RAM | search_list=100 | Milvus ≥2.3 + fast NVMe required |
| FLAT | Ground truth / <1 M vectors | — | Brute-force; exact recall |
| AUTOINDEX | Prototyping only | — | Resolves to HNSW internally |
| GPU_IVF_FLAT, GPU_CAGRA | GPU workloads | — | CUDA hardware required |

Default for production RAG: **HNSW** (M=16, efConstruction=256).

## Step 4 — Select consistency level

| Level | Guarantee | Performance | When to use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Strong | Read-your-writes; fully linearisable | Highest latency | Test assertions; financial records |
| Bounded (default) | Reads lag by a bounded delta | Low overhead | Most RAG and search workloads |
| Session | Read-your-own-writes within a session | Low overhead | User-facing apps with immediate feedback |
| Eventually | No freshness guarantee | Lowest overhead | Analytics; batch scoring |

Default: **Bounded**.

---

## Step 5 — Verify authentication pattern and schema constraints

**Authentication (universal):**

| Mode | Code |
|------|------|
| No auth (dev only) | `MilvusClient(uri=uri)` |
| Username + password | `MilvusClient(uri=uri, user="u", password="p", secure=True)` |
| Token | `MilvusClient(uri=uri, token="<token>", secure=True)` |

**Schema constraints:**

- Schema is **immutable** in Milvus ≤2.5 — all fields must be designed before creation
- VARCHAR `max_length`: up to 65,535 characters
- `enable_dynamic_field=True` allows arbitrary extra fields but prevents scalar indexing on them

**Scalar index types for filter performance:**

| Type | Use case |
|------|----------|
| TRIE | VarChar equality and prefix matching |
| INVERTED | General scalar filtering (recommended default) |
| STL_SORT | Numeric range queries |
