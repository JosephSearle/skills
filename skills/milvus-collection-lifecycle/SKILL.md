# Milvus Collection Lifecycle Skill

All collection CRUD operations: create, list, load, release, describe, drop, and alias
management. Consult milvus-context for cluster limits before creating collections.
For index tuning use milvus-index-management; for inserts use milvus-data-ingestion.

---

## Core Philosophy

A collection must be **loaded** before it can be searched or queried, and **released** before
it can be dropped. Always verify collection state with `milvus_get_collection_info` after
creation and after load — don't assume success without confirming `load_state`.

---

## Step 1 — Check existing collections

Before creating, confirm the collection doesn't already exist and the cluster is within limits
(milvus-context → Step 2).

```json
{ "name": "milvus_list_collections", "arguments": {} }
```

If the target collection name is already listed, skip creation and proceed to load if needed.

---

## Step 2 — Choose a creation path

```
Is this a quick prototype or proof-of-concept?
  └─ YES → Path A: quick-setup (auto-schema, minimal parameters)
  └─ NO  → Path B: full schema (run milvus-schema-design first to produce field_schema JSON)
```

**Path A — Quick setup:**

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_create_collection",
  "arguments": {
    "collection_name": "my_collection",
    "dimension": 768,
    "metric_type": "COSINE"
  }
}
```

Defaults applied: `index_type=HNSW`, `M=16`, `efConstruction=256`. Suitable for prototyping;
run milvus-schema-design before any production collection.

**Path B — Full schema:**

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_create_collection",
  "arguments": {
    "collection_name": "my_collection",
    "metric_type": "COSINE",
    "field_schema": "<JSON from milvus-schema-design>",
    "index_params": [
      {
        "field_name": "embedding",
        "index_type": "HNSW",
        "metric_type": "COSINE",
        "params": {"M": 16, "efConstruction": 256}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Always set `index_params` at creation time — post-creation re-indexing is expensive on large
collections.

**Shard count:** default is 2. Raise to 4+ for write throughput >10K rows/s on Distributed.

---

## Step 3 — Load the collection

A collection must be loaded into memory before searches or queries. Always load after creation.

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_load_collection",
  "arguments": {
    "collection_name": "my_collection",
    "replica_number": 1
  }
}
```

- `replica_number=1` for dev/test; set `2+` for high-availability production
- Never load an already-loaded collection without releasing first

---

## Step 4 — Inspect collection state

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_get_collection_info",
  "arguments": { "collection_name": "my_collection" }
}
```

Confirm: `load_state = "Loaded"` before running any search. Check `index_status` shows
`Indexed` for all vector field segments after indexing.

---

## Step 5 — Manage collection lifecycle

**Release** (free query-node memory; required before drop):

```json
{ "name": "milvus_release_collection", "arguments": { "collection_name": "my_collection" } }
```

**Drop** (irreversible): first release, then use PyMilvus — no MCP tool for drop:

```python
client.drop_collection("my_collection")
```

**Aliases (blue-green deploys):** swap which collection a query hits without changing client code.

```python
client.create_alias(collection_name="new_collection", alias="prod")
client.alter_alias(collection_name="new_collection", alias="prod")
client.drop_alias(alias="prod")
```

Pattern: create `new_collection` → index → load → `alter_alias` to point at new → release old.

---

## Step 6 — Resolve common failures

| Error | Root cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Collection already exists | Name collision | Check with `milvus_list_collections` first |
| Exceeds max collections | Cluster limit reached | Check milvus-context → Step 2; release/drop unused |
| OOM on load | Insufficient query-node memory | Reduce `replica_number` or release other collections |
| Drop fails | Collection still loaded | Release before drop |
