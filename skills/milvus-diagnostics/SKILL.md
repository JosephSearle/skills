# Milvus Diagnostics Skill

Triage entry point for all Milvus problems: slow search, wrong results, auth failures,
ingestion errors, or unexpected empty results. Establishes a baseline, branches to the
relevant symptom tree, and references the owning skill for remediation. Always document
root cause and fix — use `references/incident-log-template.md` as the record.

---

## Core Philosophy

Establish baseline state before diagnosing. A single `milvus_get_collection_info` call tells
you whether the connection works, whether the collection is loaded, and whether the index
was built. Most failures trace back to one of these three states being wrong.

---

## Step 1 — Establish baseline

```json
{
  "name": "milvus_get_collection_info",
  "arguments": { "collection_name": "<collection_name>" }
}
```

```
Call succeeds?
  └─ NO  → Go to Branch C: Auth / Permission denied
  └─ YES → Note: load_state, row_count, index_status. Continue to symptom branch.
```

---

## Step 2 — Branch A: Slow search

Check the Search-Latency-by-Phase Grafana panel (see milvus-observability). Identify the
dominant phase:

```
Queue phase dominant?
  └─ YES → Too many concurrent queries or query nodes overloaded
           Fix: reduce concurrent search rate; scale query nodes

Vector-search phase dominant?
  └─ First search after load?  → Cold index; warm up with 3–5 dummy searches
  └─ No / wrong index size?    → Re-evaluate index type (milvus-index-management)

Reduce phase dominant?
  └─ topK too large?           → Reduce `limit`
  └─ output_fields too broad?  → Specify only needed fields (avoid "*")

[Search slow] log marker present, all phases normal?
  └─ Check milvus-context → Deployment overrides for known delays (e.g., upgrade windows)
     Retry with exponential backoff.
```

---

## Step 3 — Branch B: Wrong or missing results

```
Deleted entities still appearing in search results?
  └─ Bounded consistency + compaction not yet run
     Fix: use Strong consistency on the next search, OR trigger manual compaction
     → milvus-lifecycle-compaction-ttl

Expected entity not found?
  └─ Run milvus_query with the primary key filter:
     { "filter_expr": "id == <expected_id>", "output_fields": ["id"] }

     Entity absent from query?
       └─ Check insert was committed → milvus-data-ingestion Step 6 (verify)

     Entity present in query but missing from vector search?
       └─ Check filter_expr in the search — it may exclude the entity
       └─ Check metric_type mismatch (index vs search must match)
       └─ Check query vector normalisation — for COSINE, un-normalised vectors return
          near-zero similarity scores that fall below implicit thresholds

Wrong result order?
  └─ metric_type mismatch between index and search call
     Fix: rebuild index with correct metric → milvus-index-management Step 4
```

---

## Step 4 — Branch C: Auth / Permission denied

```
Check credential format against milvus-context → Step 5 (Authentication patterns)
and Deployment overrides.

Credential format correct?
  └─ NO  → Fix credential format; retry connection (milvus-connection-auth)
  └─ YES → Check RBAC grants at global / database / collection scope
           → milvus-multi-tenancy Step 4 (RBAC)
```

---

## Step 5 — Branch D: Insert / ingestion failure

```
"Message size too large" error?
  └─ Batch exceeds deployment message-size limit
     Check milvus-context → Deployment overrides for the cap
     Fix: halve batch size; recalculate using milvus-data-ingestion Step 2 formula

Rate limit or throttling?
  └─ Reduce concurrent write rate; add exponential backoff between batches

Insert appears to succeed but query returns empty?
  └─ Consistency lag → wait for Bounded window or switch to Strong
  └─ Collection not loaded → confirm load_state = "Loaded" in milvus_get_collection_info
```

---

## Step 6 — Branch E: Index not built / brute-force search

```
milvus_get_collection_info shows index_status ≠ "Indexed"?

  Segment row_count < 1,024?
    └─ Brute-force is expected below this threshold — not an error; ingest more data

  Segments > 1,024 rows but no index?
    └─ create_index was never called (or failed silently)
       Fix: call PyMilvus create_index → milvus-index-management Step 4
```

---

## Step 7 — Branch F: Empty results (no error)

Work through this checklist in order:

1. **Collection loaded?** `milvus_get_collection_info` → `load_state`. If `"Released"` →
   call `milvus_load_collection` (milvus-collection-lifecycle).

2. **Any data at all?**

   ```json
   {
     "name": "milvus_query",
     "arguments": { "collection_name": "...", "filter_expr": "id > 0", "output_fields": ["id"], "limit": 1 }
   }
   ```

   Empty response → no data ingested. Run milvus-data-ingestion.

3. **Filter too restrictive?** Remove `filter_expr` and re-search — if results appear, the
   filter eliminates all candidates.

4. **Query vector normalised?** For COSINE metric, un-normalised query vectors produce
   near-zero cosine similarity scores. Normalise the vector before searching.

## Step 8 — Quick-reference error table

| Error / symptom | Most likely cause | Skill for fix |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Collection not found | Wrong database or collection name | milvus-collection-lifecycle |
| No available query node | All nodes overloaded | milvus-observability (scale) |
| topK exceeds limit | `limit + offset > 16,384` | milvus-search-optimization |
| Slow after many deletes | Compaction debt | milvus-lifecycle-compaction-ttl |
| Wrong result order | metric_type mismatch | milvus-index-management |
| Stale deletes in results | Bounded consistency + no compaction | milvus-lifecycle-compaction-ttl |
| Cannot connect at all | Auth or network | milvus-connection-auth |

---

## Step 9 — Verify fix and document

Re-run the original failing operation with `consistency_level: "Strong"`. Confirm expected
results. Record in an incident log using `references/incident-log-template.md`.
